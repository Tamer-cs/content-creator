Anxiety is your brain trying to protect you from imagined future danger.
It treats thoughts like alarms, even when nothing is happening.
The body reacts first, and the mind creates a story later.
That is why fear can feel certain even without proof.
Learning to pause breaks the illusion of immediate threat.
