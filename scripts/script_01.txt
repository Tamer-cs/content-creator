Your mind keeps asking the same question at night like it expects a different answer.
Overthinking feels productive, but it is just fear wearing the mask of analysis.
The brain hates uncertainty more than it hates bad outcomes.
So it loops, searching for control that does not actually exist.
Peace often starts when you stop trying to solve feelings like math.
